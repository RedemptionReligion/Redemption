# Taoism and Redemptionism: Building Bridges

### Introduction

We want to begin by affirming that this dialogue is not about passing judgment or suggesting that one belief system is superior to another. Instead, Redemptionism seeks to build bridges between its own ethical teachings and those of Taoism. Both Taoism and Redemptionism have valuable lessons to share, and by working together, we believe we can foster a more balanced, virtuous, and harmonious world.

### Respectful Comparison

While Redemptionism is still exploring and debating the specific nature of forces like the Tao, we remain open to new interpretations. We believe that the creators of our universe may have crafted it in a way that emphasizes living virtuous and ethical lives, and perhaps they did so through the creation of something akin to the Tao. Living virtuously and ethically indeed brings balance and peace.

We slightly differ from the concept of Wu Wei. Redemptionism encourages active ethical living and taking intentional, well-thought-out actions to create positive change in the world. While we respect the notion that non-action can be an important part of life, we believe it must be balanced with action-based ethical living to ensure that we make the necessary changes for societal progress.

The concept of Yin and Yang is highly regarded in Redemptionism as well. We see life’s dualities—masculine and feminine, passive and active, dark and light—as essential aspects of the human experience. Redemptionism teaches that balancing these forces, rather than ignoring one in favor of the other, is key to leading a virtuous and harmonious life.

Like Taoism, we value the natural world and encourage individuals to be true to themselves, especially during periods of self-reflection. Redemptionism also embraces a future where, through the curing of aging, we can expand human longevity, allowing more time to live in harmony with the world and continue our ethical journey.

We share Taoism’s reverence for compassion, moderation, and humility, recognizing these as cornerstones of virtuous living. Additionally, Redemptionism teaches that material desires are fleeting and do not reflect one’s contributions to society or personal virtue. Instead, we emphasize focusing on emotional and relational factors to live a meaningful life. Like Taoists, we see meditation as a powerful practice, embracing the emptiness and insights that arise from it.

### Invitation to Explore Redemptionism

We offer a framework that encourages balance, harmony, and ethical living—principles that resonate deeply with Taoism. Together, we can build a more virtuous world, while embracing both our differences and the values we share.
