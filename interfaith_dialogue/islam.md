# Islam and Redemptionism: Building Bridges

### Introduction

In this dialogue, I want to make it clear that Redemptionism does not seek to replace or challenge your faith. Rather, it aims to work alongside it, showing how both Islam and Redemptionism can support and complement each other in fostering a just, ethical, and virtuous society. By building bridges between these belief systems, we can strengthen our global community and live more compassionately.

### Respectful Comparison

Redemptionism is still exploring its understanding of the divine, whether it is monotheistic or polytheistic. However, we deeply respect and recognize the significance of Tawhid, the central belief in Islam’s monotheism: that Allah is the one and only God, without partners or equals. In this journey of exploration, we maintain the utmost respect for the clear and unwavering belief in Allah’s singularity, as taught in Islam.

We also recognize the special role of Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Islam as the final prophet and messenger of Allah. Redemptionism holds the teachings of Muhammad in high regard, particularly his emphasis on ethical living, compassion, and justice. We do not seek to challenge his status as the Seal of the Prophets, but instead, we honor his role as a guide for humanity, particularly in ethical matters. We believe that the Quran, as the word of God, offers valuable insights into virtuous living, and we see many parallels between its teachings and the values of Redemptionism.

Just as Islam emphasizes key practices such as the Shahada (declaration of faith), Zakat (charity for the needy), and self-discipline, Redemptionism values these principles as vital to spiritual and personal growth. We share a commitment to spiritual growth, empathy for others, and the importance of aligning our actions with our values.

Both Islam and Redemptionism believe in an afterlife (Akhirah), where sentient souls are judged based on their actions in this life. Those who live righteously will enter Jannah (paradise), while those who stray may enter Jahannam (hell). However, in Redemptionism, we believe that even in Jahannam, there is always a possibility of redemption and forgiveness through hardship, growth, and sacrifice. This view complements Islam’s emphasis on personal accountability and the possibility of divine forgiveness through sincere repentance.

Sharia (Islamic law) provides a comprehensive framework for justice, fairness, and ethical living. Redemptionism does not seek to replace or contradict Sharia but rather offers a complementary approach to ethics. Where Sharia provides detailed guidance on how to live a just and righteous life, Redemptionism emphasizes the ongoing cultivation of virtues such as humility, compassion, and community-building. By focusing on personal growth and ethical decision-making, Redemptionism aligns with the core values that Sharia seeks to promote, reinforcing the importance of living a virtuous life under the guidance of Allah.

Redemptionism, like Islam, places a high value on community (Ummah), and we believe that ethical living is essential for building a just and fair society. We share Islam’s commitment to justice, fairness, and the creation of an equitable society, where charity, humility, and service to others are central to virtuous living. We also believe in submitting to Allah’s will, recognizing that Allah is merciful and compassionate, always ready to forgive those who turn to Him with sincerity.
