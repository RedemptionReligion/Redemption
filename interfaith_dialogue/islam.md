# Islam and Redemptionism: Building Bridges

### Introduction

In this dialogue, I want to make it clear that Redemptionism does not seek to replace or challenge your faith. Rather, it aims to work alongside it, showing how both Islam and Redemptionism can support and complement each other in fostering a just, ethical, and virtuous society. By building bridges between these belief systems, we can strengthen our global community and live more compassionately under God’s guidance.

Redemptionism deeply respects the beliefs and practices of Islam and acknowledges the importance of faith, discipline, and devotion in the life of every Muslim. Our goal is to enrich your spiritual journey by offering perspectives on ethical living, justice, and virtue while honoring your commitment to Allah.

### Respectful Comparison

Redemptionism is still exploring its understanding of the divine, whether it is monotheistic or polytheistic. However, we deeply respect and recognize the significance of Tawhid, the absolute belief in Islam’s monotheism: that Allah is the one and only God, without partners or equals. Redemptionism holds this belief in the utmost respect and acknowledges that Islam’s commitment to the oneness of Allah is unwavering and central to the faith. Redemptionism, while still evolving in its understanding of the divine, respects Islam’s clarity on this matter.

We also honor the special role of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final prophet and messenger of Allah. Redemptionism does not seek to challenge his unique status as the Seal of the Prophets, and we deeply respect the teachings of Muhammad, particularly his emphasis on ethical living, compassion, and justice. We recognize that his guidance continues to shape the lives of billions of Muslims worldwide, and Redemptionism views his teachings as a source of wisdom in matters of ethics and virtuous living.

While Redemptionism does not offer a scripture equivalent to the Quran, we respect the Quran as the divine word of Allah. The values within the Quran align closely with Redemptionism’s emphasis on charity, justice, and humility, and we see many parallels between its teachings and the core ethical principles that Redemptionism promotes.

Islam places great importance on practices such as the Shahada (declaration of faith), Zakat (charity for the needy), and the discipline of fasting during Ramadan. Redemptionism values these principles as essential for spiritual growth and personal development. We believe that aligning our actions with our values, caring for those in need, and fostering empathy for others are central to ethical living, and Redemptionism shares this commitment with Islam.

Both Islam and Redemptionism believe in an afterlife (Akhirah) where sentient souls are judged based on their actions in this life. Those who live righteously will enter Jannah (paradise), while those who stray may enter Jahannam (hell). In Redemptionism, however, we believe that even in Jahannam, there is always a possibility of redemption through hardship, growth, and sacrifice. We see hell as a place of trial, where souls may eventually cultivate the virtues needed to enter heaven. This view complements Islam’s emphasis on personal accountability and divine forgiveness through sincere repentance.

Sharia law provides a comprehensive framework for justice, fairness, and ethical living in Islam. Redemptionism does not seek to replace or contradict Sharia but offers a complementary ethical framework focused on ongoing cultivation of virtues like humility, compassion, and community-building. Where Sharia provides detailed guidance on how to live a just and righteous life, Redemptionism focuses on personal growth and ethical decision-making, reinforcing the importance of living a virtuous life under the guidance of Allah.

Redemptionism, like Islam, places a high value on community (Ummah). We believe that ethical living is essential for building a just and fair society. We share Islam’s commitment to justice, fairness, and the creation of an equitable society where charity, humility, and service to others are central to virtuous living. Submission to Allah’s will, recognizing His mercy and compassion, and always seeking forgiveness for our faults are principles that Redemptionism holds in high regard as well.
