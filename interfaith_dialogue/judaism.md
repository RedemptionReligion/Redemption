# Judaism and Redemptionism: Building Bridges

### Introduction

In this dialogue, Redemptionism is not seeking to replace or judge Judaism. Instead, we aim to explore the shared values and ethical principles that unite our two belief systems. Both Redemptionism and Judaism are committed to creating a better, more virtuous world, and by building bridges between our traditions, we believe we can work together to make a greater impact.

### Respectful Comparison

Judaism and Redemptionism share many of the same core values and ethical principles. Both traditions hold a deep belief in God, justice, charity, humility, kindness, and respect for life. We both understand the importance of working toward creating a better world, particularly through the cultivation of virtues in our everyday lives.

In Judaism, the principle of Tikkun Olam—repairing the world—is a sacred duty. Redemptionism also embraces this concept, emphasizing the need for ethical behavior and social responsibility to improve the world around us.

We both believe in living a virtuous, ethical life, guided by principles that foster justice, love, and kindness. Just as Judaism values communal gatherings for worship, learning, and social connection, Redemptionism highly values community and the importance of coming together to support and uplift one another.

Rest, reflection, and connection with God and community are vital in both traditions. In Judaism, the observance of Shabbat provides an opportunity to rest and connect spiritually, and Redemptionism similarly recognizes the importance of rest and reflection in our lives.

### Addressing the Monotheism Challenge

Judaism’s belief in one God is central to its teachings. Redemptionism, however, is still exploring whether it is a monotheistic or polytheistic tradition. We invite members of the Jewish community to join us in this discussion and offer their perspectives. This ongoing debate within Redemptionism provides a unique opportunity for dialogue and reflection on the nature of the divine. We encourage you to explore this topic with us and share your insights.

### Invitation to Explore Redemptionism

We warmly invite Jewish individuals to explore Redemptionism and see how our ethical teachings and shared values can complement the rich tradition of Judaism. Redemptionism is not about replacing your beliefs but about offering a new perspective that can work alongside them. Together, we can continue to build a just, virtuous world.
