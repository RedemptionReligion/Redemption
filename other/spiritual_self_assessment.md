        Are there virtues or practices I’ve struggled to embrace fully?

    Future Goals
        What specific steps will I take to deepen my spiritual connection in the coming months?
        How can I be more consistent in living out the virtues of Redemptionism daily?

### Scoring and Reflection

This assessment is not meant to be graded. Instead, after answering, take time to reflect on your responses. Consider the following:

    Strengths: Which virtues or practices are you excelling in? How can you use these strengths to support others?
    Growth Areas: Where do you need improvement? What steps can you take to better align with the principles of Redemptionism?
    Commitment: Set at least two specific commitments for the next month to improve your spiritual practice.

### Final Reflection: End your self-assessment by meditating on this passage:

"Through reflection, we grow; through growth, we become. In becoming, we transcend."

Use this assessment as a regular check-in to ensure that your actions, intentions, and spiritual practices remain aligned with the highest ideals of Redemptionism.
