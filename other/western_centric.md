I do acknowledge that the current iteration of Redemptionism is western centric. I have tried to keep it as globally
friendly as possible. I do not think I have adequately reflected this in my mission. For that we are sorry. We are
calling on the global community to help refine the sacred texts to better align with global traditions and mitigate
any biases we have.
