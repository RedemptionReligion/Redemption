I do acknowledge that the current iteration of Redemptionism is western centric. I have tried to keep it as globally
friendly as possible. I do not think I have adequately reflected this in my mission. For that we are sorry. We are
calling on the global community to help refine the sacred texts to better align with global traditions and mitigate
any biases we have. 

We have found that through the creation of the images for this, there is substantial bias for white people. Even when we
craft specific prompts to increase diversity, the output is still heavily dependent on white people. Will fix later once
we find more bias-free text-to-image models
