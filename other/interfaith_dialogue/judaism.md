# Judaism and Redemptionism: Building Bridges

### Introduction

In this dialogue, Redemptionism is not seeking to replace or judge Judaism. Instead, we aim to explore the shared values and ethical principles that unite our two belief systems. Both Redemptionism and Judaism are committed to creating a better, more virtuous world, and by building bridges between our traditions, we believe we can work together to make a greater impact.

### Respectful Comparison

Judaism and Redemptionism share many of the same core values and ethical principles. Both traditions hold a deep belief in God, justice, charity, humility, kindness, and respect for life. We both understand the importance of working toward creating a better world, particularly through the cultivation of virtues in our everyday lives.

In Judaism, the principle of Tikkun Olam—repairing the world—is a sacred duty. Redemptionism also embraces this concept, emphasizing the need for ethical behavior and social responsibility to improve the world around us.

We both believe in living a virtuous, ethical life, guided by principles that foster justice, love, and kindness. Just as Judaism values communal gatherings for worship, learning, and social connection, Redemptionism highly values community and the importance of coming together to support and uplift one another.

Rest, reflection, and connection with God and community are vital in both traditions. In Judaism, the observance of Shabbat provides an opportunity to rest and connect spiritually, and Redemptionism similarly recognizes the importance of rest and reflection in our lives.

### Addressing the Monotheism Challenge

Judaism’s belief in one God is central to its teachings. Redemptionism, however, is still exploring whether it is a monotheistic or polytheistic tradition. Redemptionism deeply respects Judaism’s monotheistic belief and invites members of the Jewish community to join the conversation around this internal debate. This ongoing reflection within Redemptionism provides a unique opportunity for dialogue and exploration of the divine, while fully honoring Judaism’s commitment to monotheism.
The Covenant and Ethical Living

In Judaism, the covenant between God and the Jewish people is foundational. This covenant, established through figures such as Abraham and Moses, emphasizes the responsibility to follow God’s commandments and live ethically. Redemptionism recognizes the deep significance of this covenant and similarly holds that ethical living is essential to human growth and the betterment of society.

While Redemptionism does not claim a specific covenant, it views the relationship between humanity and the divine as one of mutual responsibility to act with virtue and care for the world. This shared sense of responsibility for ethical behavior aligns Redemptionism closely with Judaism’s values.

### Communal Practices and Rest

Both Judaism and Redemptionism place great importance on the role of community. In Judaism, communal gatherings in synagogues provide spaces for worship, learning, and fellowship. Redemptionism also values congregation, where individuals come together to learn, support each other, and engage in ethical reflection. Both traditions believe that community is essential to personal and societal growth.

Rest and reflection are key practices in both Judaism and Redemptionism. Just as Shabbat is a time for rest, connection, and reflection on God’s creation, Redemptionism emphasizes the need for regular reflection and rest to nurture the mind, body, and spirit.
