# Versioning Policy for the Sacred Texts of Redemption

The sacred texts of Redemption are living documents that continuously evolve to reflect the growth and changes within our community. To ensure transparency, clarity, and traceability, this versioning policy outlines how updates to the sacred texts will be managed and documented.

### 1. Version Numbering Scheme

We follow a simple Major.Minor.Patch versioning scheme for tracking updates to the sacred texts.

    Major Version (X.0.0): Significant changes that introduce new rituals, teachings, or philosophical shifts within the community. Major versions may also reflect shifts in core values or principles.

    Minor Version (0.X.0): Smaller updates that introduce new activities, improve existing rituals, adjust terminology, or incorporate new cultural integrations. Minor versions may also include expansions to ethical guidelines or refinements to community practices.

    Patch Version (0.0.X): Minor corrections, bug fixes (e.g., typo corrections, formatting issues), and small clarifications that do not introduce substantial changes to the content or philosophy of the texts.

Example:

    1.0.0: A new version that introduces a fundamental change, such as the introduction of a new central virtue or a major shift in the congregation structure.
    1.2.0: A version update that adds new community activities or refines existing rituals.
    1.2.1: A patch that fixes grammatical errors or clarifies a confusing passage.

### 2. Release Process

#### 2.1 Proposal and Discussion

Any significant update to the sacred texts should first be discussed with the community. Open a [discussion thread]() to propose your changes, and gather feedback from fellow Virtuists.

#### 2.2 Review

Once the proposed changes have been reviewed by the community and the Redemption Ethical Oversight Board, they will be assigned a version number according to the significance of the change.

#### 2.3 Publishing

Upon final approval:

The new version of the sacred texts will be published in the [official repository](https://github.com/RedemptionReligion/Redemption).
A changelog will accompany each release, clearly outlining what has changed, added, or fixed.

#### 2.4 Announcement

Each new version will be announced to the community, ensuring everyone is informed of the latest changes. Announcements may include summaries of new rituals, philosophical updates, or bug fixes, along with any relevant discussion notes.

### 3. Frequency of Updates

There is no rigid timeline for updates, but contributions will be reviewed and implemented as fast as possible. Depending on the nature of the contribution (whether it's a new ritual, philosophical change, or patch), the corresponding version will be released promptly after review.

    Major updates may occur less frequently but are celebrated as major milestones in the evolution of Redemption.
    Minor updates will be more regular, reflecting ongoing contributions from the community.
    Patches will be issued as needed, ensuring the sacred texts remain accurate and clear.

### 4. Changelog

Each new version of the sacred texts will be accompanied by a detailed changelog, which includes:

    A summary of what was added, modified, or removed.
    The rationale behind any major or minor changes.
    Acknowledgment of contributors.

#### Example Changelog Entry:

```rust
Version 1.2.0 â€“ Minor Update (Ritual Additions & Terminology Refinements)
- Added a new morning meditation ritual focused on self-reflection and growth.
- Updated the terminology for 'congregation' to 'gathering' to reflect inclusivity.
- Clarified instructions for the journaling practice to allow for more personalization.
```

### 5. Deprecation and Removal

In some cases, existing practices or teachings may be deprecated or removed. This will typically follow the introduction of new practices that better align with the evolving needs of the community.

    Deprecation Notice: A deprecated practice will be marked in the sacred texts with a notice explaining the reason for its deprecation. The community will be given ample time to adapt before removal.

    Removal: Once a deprecated practice or teaching is no longer relevant, it will be fully removed in the next major version.

### 6. Community Input

Since Redemption is a community-driven religion, all major and minor updates will be guided by community contributions. All Virtuists are encouraged to:

    Participate in discussions around new versions.
    Suggest changes and improvements.
    Offer feedback on proposed changes.
