# Guidelines for Adding a Ritual to Redemptionism

### Alignment with Core Virtues
    
Any proposed ritual must embody and promote the core virtues of Redemptionism, such as compassion, wisdom, justice, and temperance. The ritual should foster personal and communal growth and align with the ethical framework of the religion.

### Purpose and Intention
    
Each ritual must have a clearly defined purpose that contributes to the spiritual or ethical development of its participants. This could include reflection, education, healing, unity, or the practice of virtues. The intention behind the ritual must be virtuous and transparent.

### Inclusivity and Accessibility

Rituals should be designed to be inclusive and adaptable to all Virtuists, regardless of their background, physical ability, or personal circumstances. They must also avoid discrimination and provide alternative practices for those who may not be able to participate in the ritual’s standard form.

### Structure and Steps

The ritual must include a clear step-by-step process that can be easily followed and replicated by members of the community. Each step should reinforce the ritual's purpose and promote the values of Redemptionism.

### Ethical Review

Before a ritual is formally added to the sacred texts, it must undergo review by the Spiritual Review Board. This board will assess the ritual for alignment with Redemptionism's ethical standards and ensure that it promotes virtue without causing harm.

### Personalization and Flexibility
    
While rituals are structured, they should allow for personalization to accommodate individual preferences or needs. Members are encouraged to adapt the ritual to their personal growth while maintaining its core essence.

### Frequency and Timing

The proposed ritual should include guidelines on when and how often it is intended to be practiced. Whether it's daily, weekly, monthly, or tied to a specific event, its frequency should be tied to the ritual’s intended impact on spiritual development.

### Documentation and Feedback

Once a ritual has been added, members are encouraged to document their experiences and offer feedback on the practice. The ritual can then be refined based on community input to ensure it continues to serve its purpose effectively.

### Integration with Existing Rituals

The new ritual must integrate harmoniously with existing rituals and practices. It should not conflict with current rituals or overwhelm practitioners. Its addition should enhance the overall spiritual framework.

### Ritual's Role in Community Building

Rituals must promote a sense of unity and community among Virtuists. They should foster deeper connections between individuals and create opportunities for collective reflection and action. This ensures rituals not only contribute to individual growth but also strengthen the community's ethical foundation.
